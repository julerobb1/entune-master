Toyota entune sourcecode


from examing the sourcecode and user interface of both subaru gen 2/2.1 (denso/fujitsu ten (2015 (possibly)/2016/2017/possibly 2018 models) and toyota headunits, they both appear to run the same OS, but the toyotas seem to run it smoother/better than the gen 2 subaru units did. 

Again, I own nothing.
